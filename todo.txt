5.  Start to create bad guy sprites and sprite objects.
6.  Figure out how to do collision detection with blocks
7.  Figure out tile mapping and level creation code.

Algorithm for physics in PTB.
1.  Develop the future rect.
2.  Calculate gravity, the y axis future rect and project the future rect to see if something is below.
3.  Calculate the x axis future rect
4.  When the future rect collides then set the actual rect to the right edge.
5.  If the future rect doesn't collide then just move the actual rect.
