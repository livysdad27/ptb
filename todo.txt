1.  Remake animation as sprite/object with arbitrary size spritesheet anim.
X.  Create jump code with right/left hand move code.
X.  Scale speed to change based on locomotion type. - Made it an attribute of player object.
4.  Figure out a screen/message dialogue for narration.
5.  Start to create bad guy sprites and sprite objects.
x.  Figure out how to do collision detection with blocks
X.  Figure out tile mapping and level creation code.
x.  Find/make tiles....
9.  Figure out how to make non-collision-tiles and animated tiles.
10.  Fix how crappy my bob movement is.
11.  Better animation and spritesheeting for sprites.
12.  Figure out camera code implementation for large levels.
13.  Rewrite the bob/player class using masks in the lib dir.

Algorithm for physics in PTB.
1.  Develop the future rect.
2.  Calculate gravity, the y axis future rect and project the future rect to see if something is below.
3.  Calculate the x axis future rect
4.  When the future rect collides then set the actual rect to the right edge.
5.  If the future rect doesn't collide then just move the actual rect.  

Now we need to figure out how to test for standing.  Standing = colliding
with the top surface of a block.  Basically I need to know what I'm hitting
unless I want to scan every block and every surface on the axis every time.
Options:
1.  Create a top, right, left and bottom rect for each block?
2.  Use this as the opportunity to switch to masks???
